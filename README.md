## Course Description
Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence focused on designing algorithms that improve their performance based on empirical data. The course covers the theory and principles of machine learning, along with an overview of its applications in data analysis, computer vision, bioinformatics, and computational linguistics. The focus is on supervised learning (classification and regression) and unsupervised learning (clustering and dimensionality reduction).
